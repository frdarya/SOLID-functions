# SOLID

There are 2 matlab codes to extract images with a selected DI value.

Find_Closest_Triplets will find a triplet of images with equal dissimilarity (sim_distance) up to a chosen range (acceptablerange).

ChooseFoils will find 3 images that are at variable distances from a target (sim_distance) within a  a chosen range (acceptablerange).
