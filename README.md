# SOLID

There are 2 matlab codes to extract image with a selected DI value.
Find_Closest_Triplets will find a triplet of images with equal dissimilarity (sim_distance) up to a chosen range (acceptablerange).
ChooseFoils will find 3 images that are at a variable distance from a target (sim_distance) within a range (acceptablerange).
